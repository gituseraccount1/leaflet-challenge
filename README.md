# leaflet-challenge

Completing Part 1 of this challenge only, which is to create the earthquake visualization.

We are taking earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in order to display the data in a meaningful way for the public to see the importance of where funding should go towards. 

Please note: I was able to get the circle markers in the correct places and have the sizes match accordingly to earthquakes madnitude. I was not able to change the color of the circle markers to match the depth.
